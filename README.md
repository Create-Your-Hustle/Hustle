# Hustle

Hustle is a full-stack web application that connects individuals managing projects with potential collaborators on a social media dashboard. It provides the users with opportunities to view:

a)	Other users' skill sets, project histories, and availability for work
b)	Outstanding projects requiring users with a given skill set and availability.

The primary purpose of the platform is to facilitate initial touchpoints between project managers and potential collaborators.
